### Hymn  
**Amazing Grace**  
John Newton (1725-1807)

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch; like me!  
I once was lost, but now am found,  
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,  
And grace my fears relieved;  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed!

The Lord hath promised good to me,  
His word my hope secures;  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures.  

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,  
Bright shining as the sun,  
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise  
Than when we first begun.

_Song number: 2762836_  
_American folk-hymn melody arranged by Robert Gower (b.1952)_

### The Collect

### Reading

Psalm 1 verses 1-3  
**Read by Richard Bullock**

### Reading and words 

Kate 

**The Knowledge**  
John Hegley

I have known a love  
which was true.  
I have been beautiful  
In the eyes of the beautiful.  
I have been kissed by the lips I longed for.  
I have seen heaven  
in the eyes of the beholder  
I have been home.

### Hymn

**Here is love vast as the ocean**  
William Rees (1802-1883)

_1st verse performed solo_

Here is love, vast as the ocean,  
loving kindness as the flood:  
when the Prince of Life, our Ransom,  
shed for us His precious blood.  
Who His love will not remember?  
Who can cease to sing His praise?  
He can never be forgotten  
throughout heav’n’s eternal days.

_Congregation sing_

On the mount of crucifixion  
fountains opened deep and wide;  
through the floodgates of God’s mercy  
flowed a vast and gracious tide.  
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,  
poured incessant from above,  
and heav’n’s peace and perfect justice  
kissed a guilty world in love.  
Let me all Thy love accepting  
Love Thee ever all my days

Let me seek Thy kingdom only  
And my life be to Thy praise  
Thou alone shalt be my glory  
Nothing in this world I see  
Thou hast cleansed and sanctified me  
Thou Thyself hast set me free.

_Song number: 7194743_  
_Translated by William Edwards (1848-1929)_  
_Arrangement by Matt Redman (b.1974)_

Our Father, who art in heaven,

Give us this day our daily bread.  
And forgive us our trespasses,

For thine is the kingdom,  
the power, and the glory,  
for ever and ever.  

Amen.

### Reflection

### Commendation and Committal

**You’ll Never Walk Alone**  
Accompanied by Aaron Frith and Laura Irma

When you walk through a storm  
Hold your head up high  
And don’t be afraid of the dark  

At the end of a storm  
There’s a golden sky  
And the sweet silver song of a lark  

Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
For your dreams be tossed and blown  

Walk on, walk on  
With hope in your heart  
And you’ll never walk alone  

You’ll never walk alone

Walk on, walk on  
With hope in your heart  
And you’ll never walk alone  

You’ll never walk alone  

_Richard Rodgers (1902-1979) and Oscar Hammerstein (1895-1960)_  
_Arrangement by Gerry and the Pacemakers (1963)_

### The Blessing

May the road rise up to meet you.  
May the wind always be at your back.  
May the sun shine warm upon your face,  
and rains fall soft upon your fields.  
And until we meet again,  
May God The Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit,  
bless you and hold you in the palm of his hand.

Amen
