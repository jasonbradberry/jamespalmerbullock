I was privileged to be the Headteacher of the small school James attended up to GCSE.

He was always positive, creative and a delight to be around.

I invited James to speak at a school function some years after he had graduated to share what school meant to him with the pupils at the time.

I clearly remember him talking about a pivotal realisation in his life which came when he’d heard the U2 song ‘Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses’.

He felt the song asked him to choose to be himself; to walk his own path; to follow his destiny… and that is what he did.

In my opinion James ‘rode his wild horses’; he made the most of what the poet Mary Oliver referred to as his ‘one wild and precious life’.
