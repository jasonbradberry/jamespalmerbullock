I will always remember James for his smiley eyes and his warmth. He was always so easy to be around, so interested, easy to chat to, engaged and caring. A brilliant husband to my dear friend, and beautiful dad. James was a generous soul - always ready with a smile, hug, cup of tea and a sweet treat ☺️
