A testament to the man he was, is the fact that actually he made everyone feel valued, he gave everyone his time and attentive ear. I first met James, years ago in a Preston church event and then had the privilege of sharing great chats and fellow, northern comradeship, whilst living in Chichester. Many a party or gathering we both attended and it was always just so wonderful to feel the genuine warmth, care and energy James gave. The fact is, James and Kate, have just always been such amazing people, an amazing couple and although I wasn't a 'close friend' I feel so privileged to have been given their time and care. My memory really is just that James and Kate valued me as a person and always made me feel welcome, even recently at a baby shower where it had been years since i'd seen them both but they both welcomed me into their home and James too the time to ask how I was, what I was doing and the fact is, I knew he actually cared! So thank you James, you will always be one of the kindest people I have known and one of the most genuine of hearts. Thanks for lighting up the world with your honesty, integrity, creativity and humility.
