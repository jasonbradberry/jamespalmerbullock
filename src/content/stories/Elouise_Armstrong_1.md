Found this photo which I must have taken; my memory of this day was how hot, and full of people and joy Kate and James’ wedding day was. Golden fields, jam jars of flowers and friends for days. As with every time spent with James and Kate, it was a gathering of friends old and new. Effortless and full of love. One of many gatherings that was filled with James’ love for people and seeing the best in others that Kate and James bring out when we were with them.
