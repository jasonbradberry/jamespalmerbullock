James was such a positive person and we always had such a great laugh when our families got together. 
James and I talked about a theoretical pop up events  company that would host a mass dinner for people without revealing the location, and would pop up in public spaces such as high streets, windmills and parks for a dinner. He was such a positive soul with a can-do attitude and I just can’t believe he won’t be spreading his own personal type of joy around anymore. 
This photo was of my daughter’s 4th birthday party on West Witt on a sunny September day and all the children played beautifully whilst the grown ups enjoyed some time together.
