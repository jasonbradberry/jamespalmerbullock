When my dad was extrememly ill and in the hospital, i remember being taken to James' and Kate's house since Juno and i were very very close. My mum had to rush my dad to the hospital and i was extrememly worried, James and Kate were the first people to help out and came to pick me up. I stayed with them for days and they really helped me get my mind off of what was happening. I was looked after so well and felt super loved and welcomed by them ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—
