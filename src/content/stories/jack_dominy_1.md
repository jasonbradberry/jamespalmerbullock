I have worked closely with James for around 10 years, we would chat regularly about various design projects and tasks that were almost always last minute and urgent, but we'd always get them done.

He gave me one of my first freelance design projects and has been a huge support and inspiration throughout my journey. We would spend hours sending screenshots back-and-forth until we got things perfect and it was his passion and commitment that kept me engaged.

Whilst I don't have a specific memory or story to share he has made a huge impact on my life and my attitude towards it, and that's something I will be forever grateful for.

I'll miss receiving the frequently received message from him (usually late at night) saying "Jackâ€¦ we need this by tomorrow morning... HELP!", and because he was who he was I never let him down.

Your passion for everything you touched is admirable. You are sorely missed, James.
