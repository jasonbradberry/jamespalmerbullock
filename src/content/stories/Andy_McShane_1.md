Italy 1997 - precious times and memories, character forming and great, great fun together! 

James, what a beautiful soul. God-given, grace-filled, he ran the race his Heavenly Father marked out for him in his way!

All too soon, Jesus called his name and called him home, and now he's with his Heavenly Father. This is terrible for us and his dear family, but it is better for James by far. 

I'm sure he’s heard Jesus say to him, "Well done, good and faithful servant!"

James was a genuine blessing to all of us, and to more folk than we'll ever know. We thank and praise God for giving the gift of James.

Roll on new creation eh? Maybe then in our perfect new bodies I might be able to catch you on a football field!
