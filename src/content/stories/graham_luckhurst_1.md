“The nicest guy in dance music” was how I referred to James. But it extended far, far beyond that and could have easily been “the nicest guy in music” or “the nicest guy”, full stop.

One of the smartest and most dedicated. A deep thinker and avid innovator. James was in it for the art, the music and the culture, not for the likes and the money.

You inspired me to be a better father, a better musician and to do things for the true artform and culture not for the money. One of the biggest supporters of our ’Lemonade’ project, and without question one of the main reasons we kept pushing so hard.

The deeper you dig the more you find out about how far his generosity extends. Just this morning I heard about two more projects that he was involved with, outside of music, that were done entirely out of goodwill for others.

You wrote some of the best emails ever. Your gentle, considered yet cutting commentary of the commerciality that has crept into electronic music in recent times was hilarious.

James always wore amazing coats. That bright blue puffer was a personal favourite of mine but they were all great.

I can only imagine how incredible he was as a Dad.

A monumental loss to our scene and to our world but you gave so much to so many while you were here. 

Peace, we love you x
