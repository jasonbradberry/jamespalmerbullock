The last day of summer

The last day of summer
Our last barbecue of the year
Your last swim in the ocean.
The sun shone warm and bright
until summer took flight that night 
And we watched the darkness descend
as the season abruptly came to an end.

And that was the week that our sunflower died;
my son’s flower that he had planted with pride
and watched as it grew so majestic and tall,
climbing above the fence and the wall
As it always sought to see further, to look deeper, to face the rays of the sun,
Always looking beyond the place from where it had come. 
It was strong and firmly rooted and full of beauty 
And every time we came home it was there looking out,
A quiet but confident welcoming shout that echoed throughout our little neighbourhood and beyond…
And then, that week, the bright petals were gone.

And I find myself standing outside in the rain 
with tears on my face as I feel the pain 
That has landed upon my community and beyond,
as we remember a vibrant friend who has suddenly gone
And we don’t know why.
I look at the withered leaves and petals and I cry 
And I remember
before those dark days of September 
The friend who lived and loved and dreamed and created
Tenacious and bold and motivated
by faith and love and music and art
And he wasn’t afraid to follow his heart. 
Creativity and inclusivity were in his DNA.
I watched and I noticed and I myself grew
and began to feel safe around his unconditional love for his family,
and without any words he showed and encouraged me 
To keep walking. Keep climbing. Keep looking beyond the place from which we have come,
Keep searching and turning our face to the sun. 
Keep loving, even when it hurts 
Keep looking for beautiful flowers in the dirt 
And one day, in the midst of the pain
You will begin to see beauty again
Because blossom always returns.
