Some of our favourite memories of James were formed on a blustery weekend in January â€˜23 when we went to stay. Walking, talking, eating & generally hanging out together. James surprised us by following up on one of our conversations a few months later and got us on the guest list for a sold-out gig that one of his clients was doing in our home town.

Always so interesting to talk to, interested in others, generous with his energy & kind. We will miss him x
