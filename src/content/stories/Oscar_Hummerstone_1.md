James' kindness and generosity left an impression on me each time we met. At the first extended family gathering that I attended, he went out of his way to get to know me, and to put me at ease - particularly when it became clear to him that I had failed to recall any of the names of those to whom I'd been recently introduced.

Though I'd barely begun to get to know him, it was immediately obvious that time spent with James was something to look forward to, and to be enjoyed.
