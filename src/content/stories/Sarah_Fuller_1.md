I didn't get to spend as much time with James as regularly as I would have liked but every time I saw him I felt accepted and at ease. James had a way of making you feel valued and warmer from just being in his presence and I am grateful for the many times he did that for me. I spent a recent football training session having an easy yet meaningful chat with James whilst he was simultaneously watching and supporting Wilbur play, helping set goals up for another team and minding 2 people's phones to help them get gig tickets, I think that is one example of how kind and giving James was, a real friend to all.

Here are some lovely photos of James and his kind smile x
