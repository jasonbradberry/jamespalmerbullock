I first met James on a summer mission camp. On the last day, we all wrote messages of encouragement to each other. James’ message to me was about the importance of who I was above what I did. I was 18, and James’ message really hit home and stayed with me. Since then, James has been interested in and encouraged who I am.

We reconnected a few years later in Ibiza as members of the 24-7 Prayer team. James got me, had my back, and encouraged me as I found my tribe and sense of purpose.

James was great at asking questions to understand you. I always felt that he was genuinely really interested in me. He valued people and loved discovering what makes them tick.

A poem:

You floated in the flow of others,
Delighted in what could be generated together -
New and fresh and life-giving.
But it was always about who we are.
You helped us glimpse our spark,
and opened-up opportunities for fires to spread.
You were amazing at asking questions and seeking to understand.
You pumped hope and self-belief.
I’m shocked that you’re gone, but I’ll seek in some way to emulate
the way you always made others feel great.
