I’m going to be in New York for work and miss celebrating james with you all, but I can’t express how sad this all is. 

Anyway, this totally won’t do it any justice, but we had the most magical time spending the whole summer in Ibiza in 2024! We were the extra curriculum members of 247 so free to do our own thing, and we had some incredibly special times. How james managed to get us into dc10 guestlist every single week via Charlie Chester I never knew. Driving around with Jonah and heather and exploring the island and most of all just being there and really understanding it all, we completely were immersed in the culture and were trying to be a positive influence, something we continued. James was always just joy! And we had the greatest time, completely sober listening to the best house music in the world and grinning our way through it all! There is something incredible about music and the way it connects us, james was a lightning rod for that! But more than that james floated whilst others trudged, but his positivity and love raised people up to feel what it’s like to hope and feel joy, get through their stuff and realise how great life really is! He’s an infectious and brilliant human! I love you and I miss you.  Matt
