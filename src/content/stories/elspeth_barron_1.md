I have a million stories and I’ll probably submit some others but for now: It’s one of those small moments I would usually forget but it’s etched in my memory from my time living with the PBs. We were locked down and trying to watch less TV/Films so we decided to play Scrabble and James took ages in the kitchen concocting the perfect new cocktail he had been waiting to create. We had cheese left over from Christmas and laughed about who knows what and silly words. Listened to a playlist curated by James and I kept having to Shazam songs to add them to my own playlist. I often think about how simply beautiful that night was and how so many other night like that were when I lived with the PBs. I was probably a month or two into living with them and I thought, yeah these are my people. I have pipped a photo of that night below with a few other faves.
