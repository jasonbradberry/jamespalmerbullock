James and I raced together twice. Once over 30 meters, once over 13.1 miles - same outcome both times.

The short race was on the way to the pub - why not? I gritted my teeth, tried hard but there was no photo finish. James was fast - he just floated. 

Then in London for the half marathon, again he floated round in a ridiculously fast time. 

When I think about it, James 'floated' at life as well as running - never seemingly dragged down. 

Even on a bad day he would speak well of everyone and approach things optimistically.

You couldn't help catch what James carried, I always left feeling lighter, more optimistic and more hopeful. And sure, not race him again ;-)
