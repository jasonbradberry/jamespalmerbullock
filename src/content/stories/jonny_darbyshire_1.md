I got to know James when Emma lodged with the PB’s for over two years. James will never know the role he played as Emma and I went from being friends to getting married. James showed an unconditional love to those around him, he loved those close to him in a sacrificial way. He loved his family in a Christ-like way that has been one of the foundations for our own family life, and why we asked James and Kate to bless us with prayers at our own wedding.

I knew James in many other ways, from football to church community, but what will always stick with me, and inspire me, was how he fathered in a Christ-like way. He’s given his three amazing kids an easy example for when they need to understand how their Heavenly Father loves them.
