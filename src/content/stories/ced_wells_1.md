So many memories, adventures and gatherings. 

One of the most significant for us was our campervan trip to Dorset. Just a few months before you and Kate got married we hired a van and headed west for a long weekend. Marie and I werenâ€™t together at this point (and it took a few more trips before the penny dropped) but this was an instrumental few days in setting us up. Surfing at Westward Ho!, cockles at Clovelly and puppet shows in the cab of the van. That was one of your greatest gifts James: bringing people together in the most memorable of ways.
