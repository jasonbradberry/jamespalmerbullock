When I think of James, I can feel his positivity, his kind force of nature, and his cutting edge abilities as an electronic music industry innovator. We shared a passion for bringing people together for creative opportunities and problem solving. He projected positivity and integrity in every interaction and I always came away from our conversations feeling lifted. I think of the last time I saw him at a festival wearing an impossibly colourful jacket that may have looked out of place on most people, but looked perfect on him and matched his vibe. I think of the limitless well of ideas that shone out from his mind into the world. I felt so honoured when he asked me to start working with him on the label recently - if felt like we were just getting started, but his shining light remains, beaming out a path forward. A truly beautiful soul. I feel lucky to have known you James.
