What a privilege to have known James.

What an amazing imagination and vision he had - fairly recently asked me to consider doing a dinner on the top of Avenue de Chartres car park - we would maybe set it up with the best linen, candelabras etc and invite a local MP and promote the Chamber of Culture - turning the usual Chichester dining experience on its head and bringing a whacky Peckham rooftop vibe - the boy James could think we could turn this spot into something glorious!
