James was such a loving guy and faithful in his pursuit of God. His love for prayer and worship was beautiful. We have great memories of him at our 24/7 prayer nights and in our prayer room when he would set up his decks and play music through the night. He was with us at the very beginning of planting the Freedomcentre church in Preston and he was always supportive and encouraging. He served as one of our first trustees - he had a wonderful spirit and an infectious smile - a very special guy.
