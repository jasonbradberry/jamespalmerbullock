Many trips to Ibiza including whole seasons in a sweaty hotel room with no air con! The foundation of a 25-year friendship solidified when we both independently moved to Chichester. We stood together as we both got married, had children and chased the dreams we first spoke of at 4am on our hotel balcony. He stood by my side through the joys and the pain we travelled and I miss my friend.
